# Code Book

This code book summarizes the resulting data fields and transformations applied to create `tidydata.txt`. The base data is taken from [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). 

## Raw Data Information

The raw data for this project is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Description

Each row represents 1 Subject and 1 Activity. The raw data includes multiple measurement observations for each Subject and Activity, so these were averaged together for creating the final tidy dataset.


## Identifiers

* subject - The ID of the test subject, ranges from 1 to 30
* activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken, string with 6 values:
	* `WALKING`: subject was walking
	* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was walking upstairs
	* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was walking downstairs
	* `SITTING`: subject was sitting
	* `STANDING`: subject was standing
	* `LAYING`: subject was laying
		
## Measurements

The below list of variables are measurements taken by the smartphone for each Subject and Activity. All measurements are floating-point values, normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

## Transformations

To get Tidy Data from the Raw Data, few transformations were made. The transformations applied are shown below:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Tidy dataset was created as a mean values of features grouped by activitylabel and subject - for each subject and activity type, mean values over all activities of that type.
